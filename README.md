# SecureCrypt: RSA Cryptosystem Implementation
This project is part of the Software Security Engineering course under my bachelor's degree in software engineering

SecureCrypt is a web-based application that implements the RSA cryptosystem, allowing users to encrypt and decrypt data securely. This project is designed to provide a user-friendly interface for accessing the RSA algorithm and understanding its underlying principles.

## Project Overview
The SecureCrypt project aims to provide a user-friendly interface for the implementation of the RSA cryptosystem. The application is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, providing a responsive and visually appealing experience for users.




The home page of SecureCrypt features a logo, a paragraph describing the importance of data security and the RSA algorithm, and two call-to-action buttons that allow users to access the encryption and decryption functionalities, as well as the algorithm specifications.

### Prerequisites
To run the SecureCrypt application, you will need a modern web browser with support for HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.


## Usage

### Encryption
To encrypt data using the RSA cryptosystem, follow these steps:
1. Click the "Encrypt" button on the home page.
2. Enter the data you want to encrypt in the input field.
3. Click the "Encrypt" button.
4. The encrypted data will be displayed on the screen.


### Decryption
To decrypt data using the RSA cryptosystem, follow these steps:
1. Click the "Decrypt" button on the home page.
2. Enter the encrypted data in the input field.
3. Click the "Decrypt" button.
4. The decrypted data will be displayed on the screen.




### Algorithm Specifications
To view the algorithm specifications for the RSA cryptosystem, click the "Algorithm Specifications" button on the home page. This will display a detailed explanation of the RSA algorithm, including the key generation process, encryption, and decryption.




## Testing

### Valid Input Test Cases
The SecureCrypt application has been tested with various valid input values, resulting in successful encryption and decryption of the data.
